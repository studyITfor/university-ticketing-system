# 🚀 Railway Deployment Guide

## University Ticketing System - Railway Deployment

This guide will help you deploy the University Ticketing System to Railway, a platform that supports WebSocket connections and real-time functionality.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- GitHub account
- Railway account (sign up at [railway.app](https://railway.app))
- Git installed locally
- Node.js 18+ installed locally

## 🔧 Step 1: Prepare the Repository

### 1.1 Initialize Git Repository

```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Make initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: University Ticketing System with Railway deployment"

# Set main branch
git branch -M main
```

### 1.2 Push to GitHub

```bash
# Add GitHub remote (replace with your username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/university-ticketing-system.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## 🌐 Step 2: Deploy on Railway

### 2.1 Create Railway Account

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "Sign Up" or "Login"
3. Sign up with your GitHub account

### 2.2 Create New Project

1. Click "New Project"
2. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Choose your `university-ticketing-system` repository
4. Click "Deploy"

### 2.3 Configure Environment Variables

1. Go to your project dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Go to "Variables" tab
4. Add the following environment variables:

```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
```

### 2.4 Generate Domain

1. Go to "Settings" → "Networking"
2. Click "Generate Domain"
3. Copy the generated URL (e.g., `https://your-app-name.railway.app`)

## ✅ Step 3: Verify Deployment

### 3.1 Check Application Status

1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Check the "Deployments" tab
3. Ensure the deployment is successful (green status)

### 3.2 Test Application URLs

- **Main Application:** `https://your-app-name.railway.app`
- **Admin Panel:** `https://your-app-name.railway.app/admin.html`
- **Student Interface:** `https://your-app-name.railway.app/index.html`
- **API Base:** `https://your-app-name.railway.app/api/`

### 3.3 Test API Endpoints

Use the provided Postman collection (`postman/collection.json`) to test:

1. **System Health:** `/api/test/socket-info`
2. **Seat Status:** `/api/seat-statuses`
3. **Create Booking:** `/api/create-booking`
4. **Admin Functions:** `/api/admin/release-all-seats`

## 🔍 Step 4: Test Real-Time Features

### 4.1 WebSocket Testing

1. Open **Admin Panel** in one browser tab
2. Open **Student Interface** in another tab
3. Make changes in Admin Panel (book seats, pre-book, etc.)
4. Verify Student Interface updates in real-time

### 4.2 Browser Console Testing

Open browser developer tools and check for:
- Socket.IO connection status
- Real-time update events
- No WebSocket errors

## 🛠️ Step 5: Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Deployment Fails:**
   - Check Railway logs in the dashboard
   - Verify all dependencies are in `package.json`
   - Ensure `Dockerfile` is in the root directory

2. **WebSocket Not Working:**
   - Verify the app is using `0.0.0.0` as host
   - Check that `PORT` environment variable is set
   - Ensure Socket.IO is properly configured

3. **API Endpoints Not Responding:**
   - Check if the server is running
   - Verify CORS configuration
   - Check Railway logs for errors

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check Railway logs
railway logs

# Check service status
railway status

# View environment variables
railway variables
```

## 📊 Step 6: Monitoring

### 6.1 Railway Dashboard

- Monitor CPU and memory usage
- Check deployment logs
- View real-time metrics

### 6.2 Application Monitoring

- Monitor WebSocket connections
- Track booking statistics
- Monitor API response times

## 🔄 Step 7: Updates and Maintenance

### 7.1 Deploy Updates

```bash
# Make changes to your code
git add .
git commit -m "Update: description of changes"
git push origin main

# Railway will automatically redeploy
```

### 7.2 Rollback if Needed

1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click on "Deployments"
3. Select a previous deployment
4. Click "Redeploy"
